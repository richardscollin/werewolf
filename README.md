After attempting to GM a game I noticed the following areas for improvement.

- Spellcast Image is broken
- If a Characters Image is broken you cannot use that role
- Pointing in a public channel isn't private
    - Potential Solution: Create seperate private text channels for each role
- Voting / Nomination Workflow is too slow
- Specify Amulate in start command
- Update list of players from voice channel properly (Sometimes is pulls an outdated list)
- Add a way to exclude players from the voice channel
- Updates channel for all users
- Spectator Lobby (See all actions mirrored when dead)
